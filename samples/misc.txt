When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band

He said, "Son when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"
He said "Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?"
"Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join The Black Parade"

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, "Son when you grow up
Would you be the saviour of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone we want you all to know

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears
Ooh oh ohhhh
Disappointed faces of your peers
Ooh oh ohhhh
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I
Don't
Care!

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
You'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)

Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on)
Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on)
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
(We'll carry on!)


Bit by bit, I'm gonna get my bricks out in the sticks
Bit by bit, I'm gonna build my house in the wildest thickets
I'm gonna get away from all those mouths and my shit
I'm gonna say goodbye to all the la-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da

I'm getting on a mountain, away from the people on the ground and
Some cop sticking up my wagon

One by one
(One by one)
I'm gonna get my properties all bundled up
(Bundled up)
To the branch of a poplar tree and saunter off
With a buck and a wildebeest
We're getting lost, we're getting lost, we're getting lost

I'm getting on a mountain, away from the people on the ground and
Some cop sticking up my wagon
Chop chop we gonna build a cabin, up top on a pretty little mountain
Fuck off all you people on the ground, ya!

No I won't bring too much of anything
Maybe a little slicker for the rain
Maybe just a good book and a heart to break
I'll make a mistress of a little Wiccan thing

Bit by bit, I'm gonna get my bricks out in the sticks
Bit by bit, I'm gonna build my house in the wildest thickets
I'm gonna get away from all those mouths and my shit
I'm gonna say goodbye to all the la-di-da-di-da-di-da-di-da

I'm getting on a mountain, away from the people on the ground and
Some cop sticking up my wagon
Chop chop we gonna build a cabin, up top on a pretty little mountain
Fuck off all you people on the ground, ya!


Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide,
No escape from reality.

Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.

Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.

Mama, ooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine,
Body's aching all the time.
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.

Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows),
I don't wanna die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning,
Very, very frightening me.
(Galileo) Galileo.
(Galileo) Galileo,
Galileo Figaro
Magnifico-o-o-o-o.

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me.
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go. (Let me go!)
Will not let you go. (Let me go!)
Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go)
Oh oh oh oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go.)
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

(Ooooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me.

Any way the wind blows.

Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat

I take a hammer and I break my legs
I break them for the better
The two of them are always walking me
Into the stormy weather

I got the government to change my name, yeah
Change it all together
The silly thing it never had a ring
As though it skipped a letter, letter, letter

Now that you're all gone (all gone, all gone)
(I bet you don't feel lighter)
Well no I don't feel lighter
'Cos I'm all gone (all gone, all done)
So there's a little left over
Yeah there's a lot left over, though I'm all gone (hooo-hoo-hoo)

I take a pistol and I blow my brain
I blow it out the window
The little thing was always acting strange
And thinking like a devil

I'm getting close to reinventing me, yeah
Zeroing my levels
I get the feeling that it will not be
At all or any better, better, better

Now that you're all gone (all gone, all gone)
(I bet you don't feel lighter)
Well no I don't feel lighter
'Cos I did it wrong, did it wrong, did it wrong
So there's a little left over
Yeah there's a lot left over,
Though I'm all gone, (all gone), all gone, (all gone)

Oooooooooh
I gotta get away
From myself
I gotta get help
Oooooooooh

I take a hammer, yeah
I take a little pistol, yeah
I got the government,
I got old Prime Minister

I build a bomb, yeah a big old bomb
And I put it on a tether
Spin it around 'til the bomb goes off
And now I'm floating in the ever, ever, after

Now that you're all gone (all gone, all gone)
(I bet you don't feel lighter)
Well no I don't feel lighter
'Cos I did it wrong, did it wrong, did it wrong
So there's a little left over
Yeah there's a lot left over,
Though I'm all gone, (all gone), all gone, (all gone)


I'll be god
I'll be god
I'll be god
I'll be god, today
Hold my head under that bath and breathe away
Slit my wrists and watch that blood evaporate
Being this godly can't be good for Ana's safety Ana hear me

I'll play god
I'll play god
I'll play god
I'll play god, today
Ante up and play that god a poker game
Walk away with all our little god's spare change
Playing this god it can't be good for Ana's safety, Ana hear me

Oh, Ana, I'll be with you still
You are the angel that I couldn't kill

I'll fake god
I'll fake god
I'll fake god
I'll fake god today
Hop up on a cloud and watch the world decay
Ana on my shoulders and we'll laugh away
Faking this god it can't be good for Ana's safety,
Ana hear me, Ana baby, I'm not crazy

Oh Ana, I'll be with you still
You are the angel that I couldn't kill

Oh, Ana

Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a fish on the rocks
and it bakes in the bad sun

Oh my heart, it's a rock in the gutter
Oh my heart, it's a rock and great boulder and stuck in the gutter

And I throw my heart back to the ocean
But it don't go far, it come back floating
And I watch it wash it up with the dead fish

But it ain't quite dead, it just is like this

Oh my heart, it's a house in tornado,
Oh my heart, it's a house in the sky in the eye of tornado
Oh my heart, it's a roof in El nino
Oh my heart, it's a roof made of straw in the jaw of El nino

And I pour my heart a new foundation
But it don't set hard, it just stays shaking
And I scratch my name, I scratch my name in
But it don't set hard, it gets mixed back in

Bam bam bam, bam bam bam, bam bam bam, bam...

Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a rock in the gutter

Oh my heart, it's the black in a rainbow
Oh my heart, it's so damn so cold, so damn cold

And I throw my heart into the fire
'Cos I want to set my heart on fire
And I watch it try befriending embers
But the ice don't melt in mid-December

Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water
Oh my heart, it's a fish on the rocks
and it bakes in the bad sun


My feelings ran away
I didn't know how to treat them
Maybe if I believed them they'd have stayed
I hope they're somewhere safe
Living in a daydream
Singing to a song I couldn't play

But if I saw them on the street I'd say,
"My babies come back to me."

Cause I've got my love stuck in my head, in my head
I've got my love stuck in my thoughts, in my thoughts
I've got to keep my love, in my heart
I've got to keep my love, in my heart
I've got my love stuck in my throat, in my throat
I left my love out in the cold, in the cold
I've got to give my love, to my soul
I've got to give my love, to my soul
And let go

My angel flew away
I didn't know how to keep her
Heaven knows I needed her to stay
I hope she spreads her wings
Surfing on a sunbeam
And dancing to a song I couldn't sing

But if I saw her on the street I'd say,
"My baby fly back to me."

Cause I've got my love stuck in my head, in my head
I've got my love stuck in my thoughts, in my thoughts
I've got to keep my love, in my heart
I've got to keep my love, in my heart
I've got my love stuck in my throat, in my throat
I left my love out in the cold, in the cold
I've got to give my love, to my soul
I've got to give my love, to my soul
And let go

And maybe it's just time, it's just time that it takes, it's just time that it takes
But I don't wanna wait, I wanna love again today

My feelings ran away
I didn't know how to feel them

Cause I've got my love stuck in my head, in my head
I've got my love stuck in my thoughts, in my thoughts
I've got to keep my love, in my heart
I've got to keep my love, in my heart
I've got my love stuck in my throat, in my throat
I left my love out in the cold, in the cold
I've got to give my love, to my soul
I've got to give my love, to my soul
And let go, oh

I've got to give my love, to my soul
I've got to give my love, to my soul
And let go


If a potato
Got into government
The world would change
And if that potato
Became Prime Minister
It would be more than strange, it would be

Cut to the Leader of the Opposition
Asking him again

See, it would be

Horrible (horrible)

Disastrous (horrible)

Montage of the potato in various situations where you'd expect to see a Prime Minister


Iâve tried, tried, tried
And Iâve tried even more
Iâve Cried, Cried, Cried
And I canât recall what for
Iâve pressed, Iâve pushed, Iâve yelled, Iâve begged
In hope of some success
But the inevitable fact is that
It never will impress

Iâve no more fucks to give,
My fucks have runneth dry,
Iâve tried to go fuck shopping
But thereâs no fucks left to buy
Iâve no more fucks to give,
Though more fucks Iâve tried to get,
Iâm over my fuck budget and
Iâm now in fucking debt

I strive, strive, strive
To get everything done
Iâve played by all the rules
But Iâve very rarely won,
Iâve smiled, Iâve charmed, Iâve wooed
Iâve laughed,
Alas to no avail
Iâve run round like a moron,
To unequivocally fail!

Iâve no more fucks to give,
My fuck fuse has just blown,
Iâve been hunting for my fucks all day,
But theyâve upped and fucked off home,
Iâve no more fucks to give,
My fuck rations are depleted,
Iâve rallied my fuck army but
Itâs been fucking defeated!

The effort has just not been worth
The time or the expense
Iâve exhausted all my energy
For minimal recompense
The distinct lack of acknowledgment
Has now begun to gall
And Iâve come to realize that I
Donât give a fuck at all!

Iâve no more fucks to give,
My fucks have flown away,
My fucks are now so fucked off
Theyâve refused to fucking stay!
Iâve no more fucks to give,
My fucks have gone insane
Theyâve come back round and passed me
While theyâre fucking off again!

Iâve no more fucks to give,
My fucks have all dissolved,
Iâve planned many projects
But my fucks wonât be involved!
Iâve no more fucks to give,
My fucks have all been spent,
Theyâve fucked off from the building
And I donât know where they went!

Iâve no more fucks to give,
Iâve no more fucks to give,
Iâve no more fucks,
Iâve no more fucks,
Iâve no more fucks to give!

You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain 'til it hurts
You've taken all my money, and you want more

Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart
Of your own

Kill joy, bad guy
Big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy
To replace me?
Can you face me?

But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Feel good. Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?
I think you should
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good, feel good?

Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown school boy
Let me tan your hide

Dog with disease
You're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Know-All
Was the fin on your back part of the deal, shark?

Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart
You never did
...of your own
...right from the start

Insane, you should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride

Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null and void
Make me feel good
I feel good

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love
(All my love)
You now desert me

Love of my life, can't you see?
(Please bring it back)
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

You will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you
I still love you

Back, hurry back
Please, bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life


You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl

Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

[CHORUS]
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!

Don't ya?

[CHORUS]

You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?

So what you wanna know Calamity's child,
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh, how could they know?


I'm so happy, 'cause today I've found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
We've broke our mirrors
Sunday morning, is every day for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles, in a daze, 'cause I've found God

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there
But I don't care
I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I killed you, I'm not gonna crack

I've missed your calls for months it seems
Don't realize how mean I can be
'Cause I can sometimes treat the people
That I love like jewelry
'Cause I can change my mind each day
I didn't mean to try you on
But I still know your birthday
And your mother's favorite song

So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

I run away when things are good
And never really understood
The way you laid your eyes on me
In ways that no one ever could
And so it seems I broke your heart
My ignorance has struck again
I failed to see it from the start
And tore you open 'til the end

And I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind

And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me

Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind

And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me
And someone will love you
Someone will love you
Someone will love you
But someone isn't me


Cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles

Viral mess turned dreams into an empire
Self-made success now she rolls with Rockefellers
